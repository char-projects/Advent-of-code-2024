<h2> 🌟What is Advent of Code? </h3>
<p> Advent of Code is a calendar of programming challenges that launches every December, from the 1st to the 25th, with daily challenges that combine logic, problem solving, and holiday spirit🎅🤖 </p>

<ul>
  <li> Minimum level: The difficulty increases day by day, so at the beginning it is accessible to everyone. How far can you go? </li>
  <li> Free language: Use any programming language to solve them, be it C, C++, Python, Javascript... Even Excel or paper and pen are valid strategies. 🧑‍💻 </li>
  <li> Continuous progress: Although challenges are posted at 6am, there is no time limit. If you fall behind, you have all the time you need to deliver as much as you can. ⏳ </li>
</ul>
